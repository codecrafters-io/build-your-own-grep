The entry point for your grep implementation is in `app/main.py`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```python
# Uncomment this block to pass the first stage
if match_pattern(input_line, pattern):
    exit(0)
else:
    exit(1)
```

Push your changes to pass the first stage:

```
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```
