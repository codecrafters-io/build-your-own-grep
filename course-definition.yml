  [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (Regexes, for short) are patterns used to
  match character combinations in strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for searching
  using Regexes.

  In this challenge you'll build your own implementation of `grep`. Along the way we'll learn about Regex syntax and
  how Regexes are evaluated.

      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character.

      **Example:** `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```bash
      $ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "a"
      ```

      The `-E` flag instructs `grep` to interprets patterns as extended regular expressions (with support
      for metacharacters like `+`, `?` etc.). We'll use this flag in all stages.

      You program must [exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) with 0 if the character is found, and 1 if not.

      In this stage, we'll add support for patterns that combine the character classes we've seen so far.

      This is where your regex matcher will start to _feel_ useful.

      Keep in mind that this stage is harder than the previous ones. You'll likely need to rework your
      implementation to process user input character-by-character instead of the whole line at once.

      We recommend taking a look at the example code in ["A Regular Expression Matcher"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html)
      by Rob Pike to guide your implementation.

      **Examples:**

      - `\d apple` should match "1 apple", but not "1 orange".
      - `\d\d\d apple` should match "100 apples", but not "1 apple".
      - `\d \w\w\ws` should match "3 dogs" and "4 cats" but not "1 dog" (because the "s" is not present at the end).

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```bash
      $ echo "1 apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "\d apple"
      ```

      You program must exit with 0 if the pattern matches the input, and 1 if not.

      In this stage, we'll add support for backreferences.

      A backreference lets you reuse a captured group in a regular expression. It is denoted by `\` followed by a number, indicating the position of the captured group.

      **Examples:**
      - `(cat) and \1` should match "cat and cat", but not "cat and dog".
        - `\1` refers to the first captured group, which is `(cat)`.
      - `(\w+) and \1` should match "cat and cat" and "dog and dog", but not "cat and dog".

    difficulty: hard 
    description_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for nested backreferences. This means that a backreference is part of a larger capturing group, which itself is referenced again.

      **Examples:** `('(cat) and \2') is the same as \1` should match "'cat and cat' is the same as 'cat and cat'".

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```
      $ echo "<input>" | ./your_grep.sh -E "<pattern>"
