  [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (Regexes, for short) are patterns used to 
  match character combinations in strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for searching 
  using Regexes.

  In this challenge you'll build your own implementation of `grep`. Along the way we'll learn about Regex syntax and 
  how Regexes are evaluated.

      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character. 

      **Example:** `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash
      $ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "a"
      ```

      The `-E` flag instructs `grep` to interprets patterns as extended regular expressions (with support 
      for metacharacters like `+`, `?` etc.). We'll use this flag in all stages.

      You program must [exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) with 0 if the character is found, and 1 if not.

      [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).

      `\d` matches any digit. 

      **Example:** `\d` should match "3", but not "c".

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash
      $ echo "apple123" | ./your_grep.sh -E "\d"

      **Example:** `\w` should match "foo101", but not "$!?".

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash

      In this stage, we'll add support for [positive character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#positive-character-group--).

      Positive character groups match any character that is present within a pair of square brackets.

      **Example:** `[abc]` should match "apple", but not "dog".

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash

      Negative character groups match any character that is not present within a pair of square brackets.

      **Example:** `[^abc]` should match "dog", but not "cab" (since all characters are either "a", "b" or "c").

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash
      $ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "[^abc]"

    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for patterns that combine the character classes we've seen so far. 

      This is where your regex matcher will start to _feel_ useful. 

      Keep in mind that this stage is harder than the previous ones. You'll likely need to rework your 
      implementation to process user input character-by-character instead of the whole line at once. 

      We recommend taking a look at the example code in ["A Regular Expression Matcher"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html) 
      by Rob Pike to guide your implementation.

      **Examples:** 

      - `\d apple` should match "1 apple", but not "1 orange".
      - `\d\d\d apple` should match "100 apples", but not "1 apple".
      - `\d \w\w\ws` should match "3 dogs" and "4 cats" but not "1 dog" (because the "s" is not present at the end).

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash
      $ echo "1 apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "\d apple"
      ```

      You program must exit with 0 if the pattern matches the input, and 1 if not.

      `^` doesn't match a character, it matches the start of a line.

      **Example:** `^log` should match "log", but not "slog".

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash
      $ echo "log" | ./your_grep.sh -E "^log"
