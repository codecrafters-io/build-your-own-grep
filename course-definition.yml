  [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (Regexes, for short) are patterns used to 
  match character combinations in strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for searching 
  using Regexes.
  
  In this challenge you'll build your own implementation of `grep`. Along the way we'll learn about Regex syntax, how 
  parsers/lexers work, and how regular expressions are evaluated.

        Didn't even know that was possible!

stages:
  - slug: "init"
    name: "Match a literal character"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character. 
      
      **Example:**
      
      `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

  - slug: "match_digit"
    name: "Match digits"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\d` 
      [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).
      
      `\d` matches any digit. 
      
      **Example:**
      
      `\d` should match "1", but not "a".

  - slug: "match_alphanumeric"
    name: "Match alphanumeric characters"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\w` 
      [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).
      
      `\w` matches any alphanumeric character (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`).
      
      **Example:**
      
      `\w` should match "foo101", but not "$!?".

  - slug: "positive_character_groups"
    name: "Positive Character Groups"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for [positive character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#positive-character-group--).
      
      Positive character groups match any character that is present within a pair of square brackets.
      
      **Example:**
      
      `[abc]` should match "apple", but not "dog".

  - slug: "negative_character_groups"
    name: "Negative Character Groups"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for [negative character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#negative-character-group-).
      
      Positive character groups match any character that is not present within a pair of square brackets.
      
      **Example:**
      
      `[^abc]` should match "dog", but not "apple" (since it contains "a").

  - slug: "start_of_string_anchor"
    name: "Start of string anchor"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for `^`, the [Start of String or Line anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions#start-of-string-or-line-). 
      
      `^` doesn't match a character, it matches the start of a line.
      
      **Example:**
      
      `^log` should match "log", but not "slog".

  - slug: "end_of_string_anchor"
    name: "End of string anchor"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for `$`, the [End of String or Line anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions#start-of-string-or-line-).
      
      `$` doesn't match a character, it matches the end of a line.
      
      **Example:**
      
      `dog$` should match "dog", but not "dogs".

  - slug: "one_or_more_quantifier"
    name: "Match one or more times"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for `+`, the [one or more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-one-or-more-times-) quantifier.
      
      **Example**: 
      
      - `a+` should match "apple" and "SaaS", but not "dog".

  - slug: "zero_or_one_quantifier"
    name: "Match zero or one times"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for `?`, the [zero or one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-one-or-more-times-) quantifier (also known as the "optional" quantifier).
      
      **Example**: 
      
      - `dogs?` should match "dogs" and "dog", but not "cat".

  - slug: "wildcard"
    name: "Wildcard"

    name: "Alternation"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |
      TBD.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for the `|` keyword, which allows combining multiple patterns in an either/or fashion.
      
      **Example**: 
      
      - `(cat|dog)` should match "dog" and "cat", but not "apple".
