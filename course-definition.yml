  Regular expressions (Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In this
  challenge you'll build your own implementation of grep, a CLI tool for searching using Regexes.

  Along the way you'll learn about Regex syntax, character classes, quantifiers and more.

      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character.

      **Example:** `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```bash
      $ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "a"
      ```

      The `-E` flag instructs `grep` to interprets patterns as extended regular expressions (with support
      for metacharacters like `+`, `?` etc.). We'll use this flag in all stages.

      You program must [exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) with 0 if the character is found, and 1 if not.

      In this stage, we'll add support for patterns that combine the character classes we've seen so far.

      This is where your regex matcher will start to _feel_ useful.

      Keep in mind that this stage is harder than the previous ones. You'll likely need to rework your
      implementation to process user input character-by-character instead of the whole line at once.

      We recommend taking a look at the example code in ["A Regular Expression Matcher"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html)
      by Rob Pike to guide your implementation.

      **Examples:**

      - `\d apple` should match "1 apple", but not "1 orange".
      - `\d\d\d apple` should match "100 apples", but not "1 apple".
      - `\d \w\w\ws` should match "3 dogs" and "4 cats" but not "1 dog" (because the "s" is not present at the end).

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```bash
      $ echo "1 apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "\d apple"
      ```

      You program must exit with 0 if the pattern matches the input, and 1 if not.

    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for backreferences.

      A backreference lets you reuse a captured group in a regular expression. It is denoted by `\` followed by a number, indicating the position of the captured group.

      **Examples:**
      - `(cat) and \1` should match "cat and cat", but not "cat and dog".
        - `\1` refers to the first captured group, which is `(cat)`.
      - `(\w+) and \1` should match "cat and cat" and "dog and dog", but not "cat and dog".
        - `\1` refers to the first captured group, which is `(\w+)`.

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```
      $ echo "<input>" | ./your_grep.sh -E "<pattern>"
      ```

      Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.

      **Note:** You only need to focus on one backreference and one capturing group in this stage. We'll get to handling multiple backreferences in the next stage.

    name: "Multiple Backreferences"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      In this stage, we'll add support for multiple backreferences.

      Multiple backreferences allow you to refer to several different captured groups within the same regex pattern.

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```
      $ echo "<input>" | ./your_grep.sh -E "<pattern>"
      ```

      Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for multiple backreferences (`\1`, `\2` etc.) in the same pattern.

      **Example:**
      - `(\d+) (\w+) squares and \1 \2 circles` should match "3 red squares and 3 red circles" but should not match "3 red squares and 4 red circles".

      In this stage, we'll add support for nested backreferences. This means that a backreference is part of a larger capturing group, which itself is referenced again.

      **Example:** `('(cat) and \2') is the same as \1` should match "'cat and cat' is the same as 'cat and cat'".

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```
      $ echo "<input>" | ./your_grep.sh -E "<pattern>"
      ```

      Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.
