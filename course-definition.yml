  Regular expressions (or Regexes) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In this challenge, you'll build a Regex engine from scratch by recreating grep, a CLI tool for regex-based searching.

  Along the way you'll learn about Regex syntax, character classes, quantifiers and more.

    name: "Match a literal character"
    difficulty: very_easy
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character.

      **Example:**

      `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

  - slug: "oq2"
    name: "Match digits"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\d`
      [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).

      `\d` matches any digit.

      **Example:** `\d` should match "3", but not "c".

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```bash
      $ echo -n "apple123" | ./your_program.sh -E "\d"
      ```

      Your program must exit with 0 if a digit is found in the string, and 1 if not.

       ### Notes

      - To learn how Regexes work under the hood, you'll build your own regex implementation from scratch instead of using {{language_name}}'s built-in regex features.

      In this stage, we'll add support for patterns that combine the character classes we've seen so far.

      This is where your regex matcher will start to _feel_ useful.

      Keep in mind that this stage is harder than the previous ones. You'll likely need to rework your
      implementation to process user input character-by-character instead of the whole line at once.

      We recommend taking a look at the example code in ["A Regular Expression Matcher"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html)
      by Rob Pike to guide your implementation.

      **Examples:**

      - `\d apple` should match "1 apple", but not "1 orange".
      - `\d\d\d apple` should match "100 apples", but not "1 apple".
      - `\d \w\w\ws` should match "3 dogs" and "4 cats" but not "1 dog" (because the "s" is not present at the end).

      Your program will be executed like this:

      ```bash
      $ echo -n "1 apple" | ./your_program.sh -E "\d apple"
      ```

      Your program must exit with 0 if the pattern matches the input, and 1 if not.

      A backreference lets you reuse a captured group in a regular expression. It is denoted by `\` followed by a number, indicating the position of the captured group.

      **Examples:**

        - `\1` refers to the first captured group, which is `(cat)`.
      - `(\w+) and \1` should match "cat and cat" and "dog and dog", but not "cat and dog".
