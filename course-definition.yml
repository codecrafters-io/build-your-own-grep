  Regular expressions (or Regexes) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In this challenge, you'll build a Regex engine from scratch by recreating grep, a CLI tool for regex-based searching.

  Along the way you'll learn about Regex syntax, character classes, quantifiers and more.

stages:
  - slug: "cq2"
    name: "Match a literal character"
    difficulty: very_easy
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character.

      **Example:**

      `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

  - slug: "oq2"
    name: "Match digits"
    difficulty: very_easy
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\d`
      [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).

      `\d` matches any digit.

      **Example:**

      `\d` should match "1", but not "a".

  - slug: "mr9"
    name: "Match word characters"
    difficulty: very_easy
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\w`
      [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).

      `\w` matches any alphanumeric character (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and underscore `_`.

      **Example:**

      `\w` should match "foo101", but not "$!?".

  - slug: "tl6"
    name: "Positive Character Groups"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for [positive character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#positive-character-group--).

      Positive character groups match any character that is present within a pair of square brackets.

      **Example:**

      `[abc]` should match "apple", but not "dog".

  - slug: "rk3"
    name: "Negative Character Groups"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for [negative character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#negative-character-group-).

      Negative character groups match any character that is not present within a pair of square brackets.

      **Example:**

      `[^abc]` should match "dog", but not "cab" (since all characters are either "a", "b" or "c").

  - slug: "sh9"
    name: "Combining Character Classes"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll support patterns that combine the character classes we've seen so far.

      **Examples:**

      - `\d apple` should match "1 apple", but not "1 orange".
      - `\d\d\d apple` should match "100 apples", but not "1 apple".
      - `\d \w\w\ws` should match "3 dogs" and "4 cats" but not "1 dog" (because the "s" is not present at the end).

      This stage is significantly harder than the previous ones. You'll likely need to rework your
      implementation to process user input character-by-character instead of the whole line at once.

  - slug: "rr8"
    name: "Start of string anchor"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for `^`, the [Start of String or Line anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions#start-of-string-or-line-).

      `^` doesn't match a character, it matches the start of a line.

      **Example:**

      `^log` should match "log", but not "slog".

  - slug: "ao7"
    name: "End of string anchor"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for `$`, the [End of String or Line anchor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions#end-of-string-or-line-).

      `$` doesn't match a character, it matches the end of a line.

      **Example:**

      `dog$` should match "dog", but not "dogs".

  - slug: "fz7"
    name: "Match one or more times"
    difficulty: hard
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for `+`, the [one or more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-one-or-more-times-) quantifier.

      **Example**:

      - `a+` should match "apple" and "SaaS", but not "dog".

  - slug: "ny8"
    name: "Match zero or one times"
    difficulty: hard
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for `?`, the [zero or one](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-zero-or-one-time-) quantifier (also known as the "optional" quantifier).

      **Example**:

      - `dogs?` should match "dogs" and "dog", but not "cat".

  - slug: "zb3"
    name: "Wildcard"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for `.`, which matches any character.

      **Example**:

      - `d.g` should match "dog", but not "cog".

  - slug: "zm7"
    name: "Alternation"
    difficulty: hard
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, we'll add support for the `|` keyword, which allows combining multiple patterns in an either/or fashion.

      **Example**:

      - `(cat|dog)` should match "dog" and "cat", but not "apple".

  # Backreferences

  - slug: "sb5"
    primary_extension_slug: "backreferences"
    name: "Single Backreference"
    difficulty: hard
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for single backreferences. You'll implement support for `\1`.

      **Example:**
      - `(cat) and \1` should match "cat and cat", but not "cat and dog".

  - slug: "tg1"
    primary_extension_slug: "backreferences"
    name: "Multiple Backreferences"
    difficulty: medium
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for multiple backreferences (`\1`, `\2` etc.) in the same pattern.

      **Example:**
      - `(\d+) (\w+) squares and \1 \2 circles` should match "3 red squares and 3 red circles" but should not match "3 red squares and 4 red circles".

  - slug: "xe5"
    primary_extension_slug: "backreferences"
    name: "Nested Backreferences"
    difficulty: hard
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for nested backreferences.

      **Example:**
      - `('(cat) and \2') is the same as \1` should match "'cat and cat' is the same as 'cat and cat'".

  - slug: "dr5"
    primary_extension_slug: "file-search"
