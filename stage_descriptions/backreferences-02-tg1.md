In this stage, you'll add support for multiple backreferences.

### Multiple Backreferences

In a previous stage, you handled a single backreference. Now you'll extend this to support multiple captured groups and multiple backreferences in the same pattern.

Each set of parentheses creates a numbered capturing group, and you can reference any of them using `\1`, `\2`, `\3`, etc.

For example:
- `(\d+) (\w+) and \1 \2` matches `"3 red and 3 red"`
- `(\d+) (\w+) and \1 \2` does not match `"3 red and 4 red"` (`3` ≠ `4`)
- `(\d+) (\w+) and \1 \2` does not match `"3 red and 3 blue"` (`red` ≠ `blue`)
- `(cat) and (dog) are \2 and \1` matches `"cat and dog are dog and cat"` (order reversed)
- `(\w+)-(\w+)-\1-\2` matches `"foo-bar-foo-bar"`

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```
$ echo -n "3 red squares and 3 red circles" | ./your_program.sh -E "(\d+) (\w+) squares and \1 \2 circles"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern with all backreferences.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

### Notes
- You'll need to track multiple captured groups and their matched text simultaneously. Consider using an array or map indexed by the group number.
- Each backreference must match the exact text captured by its corresponding group, not just any text that would match the group's pattern.
- The backreferences can appear in any order and can be reused multiple times (e.g., `\1` can appear twice in the same pattern).

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
