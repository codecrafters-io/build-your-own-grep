In this stage, we'll add support for multiple backreferences.

Multiple backreferences allow you to refer to several different captured groups within the same regex pattern.

**Example:** `(\d+) (\w+) squares and \1 \2 circles` should match "3 red squares and 3 red circles" but should not match "3 red squares and 4 red circles".

Your program will be executed like this:

```
$ echo -n "<input>" | ./your_program.sh -E "<pattern>"
```

Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
