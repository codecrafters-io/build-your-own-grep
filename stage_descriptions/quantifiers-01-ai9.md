In this stage, you'll add support for the zero or more quantifier (`*`).

### The `*` Quantifier

The `*` quantifier matches the preceding element zero or more times. This means the element can be absent entirely or repeated any number of times.

For example:
- `ca*t` matches `"ct"` (zero `"a"`s)
- `ca*t` matches `"caaat"` (three `"a"`s)
- `ca*t` does not match `"dog"` (no match for the pattern)
- `k\d*t` matches `"kt"` (zero digits)
- `k\d*t` matches `"k1t"` (one digit)
- `k\d*t` does not match `"kabct"` (has letters, not digits)
- `k[abc]*t` matches `"kt"` (zero characters)
- `k[abc]*t` matches `"kat"` (one character from the set)
- `k[abc]*t` matches `"kabct"` (multiple characters from the set)
- `k[abc]*t` does not match `"kaxyzt"` (contains `"x"`, `"y"`, `"z"` which aren't in `[abc]`)

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "apple" | ./your_program.sh -E "apple*"
```

Your program must:
- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
