In this stage, you'll add support for the wildcard character.

### The `.` Character

The `.` is a special character that matches any single character except a newline. It's often called the "wildcard" because it acts as a placeholder for any character.

For example:
- `d.g` matches `"dog"` (`.` matches `"o"`)
- `d.g` matches `"dag"` (`.` matches `"a"`)
- `d.g` matches `"d9g"` (`.` matches `"9"`)
- `d.g` does not match `"cog"` (doesn't start with `"d"`)
- `d.g` does not match `"dg"` (`.` requires exactly one character)
- `...` matches `"cat"` (three dots match any three characters)
- `.\d.` matches `"a1b"` (one letter followed by a digit and another letter)

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "dog" | ./your_program.sh -E "d.g"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the given pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
