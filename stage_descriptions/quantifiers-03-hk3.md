In this stage, we'll add support for `{n,}`, the [at least n times](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-at-least-n-times-n) quantifier.

The `{n,}` quantifier matches the preceding element at least n times. The element must appear n or more times, with no upper limit.

**Examples**:
- `ca{2,}t` should match "caat", "caaat", and "caaaaat", but not "cat".
- `x\d{3,}y` should match "x123y", "x9999y", and "x12345y", but not "x42y".
- `b[aeiou]{2,}r` should match "baer", "baeiour", and "beeeeer", but not "bar".

Your program will be executed like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "caat" | ./your_program.sh -E "ca{2,}t"
```

Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
