In this stage, we'll add support for the `{n,}` quantifier.

### The `{n,}` Quantifier

The `{n,}` quantifier matches the preceding element at least `n` times. This means the element must appear `n` or more times, with no upper limit.

For example:
- `ca{2,}t` matches `"caat"` (exactly two `"a"`s)
- `ca{2,}t` matches `"caaaaat"` (six `"a"`s)
- `ca{2,}t` does not match `"cat"` (only one `"a"`)
- `x\d{3,}y` matches `"x9999y"` (four digits)
- `x\d{3,}y` does not match `"x42y"` (only two digits)
- `b[aeiou]{2,}r` matches `"baeiour"` (five vowels)
- `b[aeiou]{2,}r` does not match `"bar"` (only one vowel)

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "caaat" | ./your_program.sh -E "ca{2,}t"
```

Your program must:
- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
