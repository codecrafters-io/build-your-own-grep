In this stage, you'll add support for the digit (`\d`) character class.

### Character Classes

[Character classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions) are special patterns in regular expressions that match specific sets of characters. Instead of matching a single literal character (like "a" or "3"), a character class matches any character from a defined group.

Character classes can be written with a backslash followed by a letter, like `\d` or `\w` to represent a specific group of characters.

### The `\d` Character Class

The `\d` character class matches any single digit character (`0-9`).

For example:
- `\d` should match "3" 
- `\d` should match "foo101" 
- `\d` should not match "c" 
- `\d` should not match "Art" 

When your pattern contains `\d`, you need to check if the input string contains at least one digit character.

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "apple123" | ./your_program.sh -E "\d"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if it finds a digit in the input string.
- Exit with code `1` if it finds no digits in the input string.

### Notes

- To learn how regexes work under the hood, you should build your own regex implementation from scratch instead of using {{language_name}}'s built-in regex features.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
