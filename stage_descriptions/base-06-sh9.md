In this stage, you'll add support for combining multiple character classes in a single pattern.

### Matching Pattern Sequences

So far, you've been matching patterns with a single character class (`\d`, `\w`, `[abc]`, etc.). Now you'll handle patterns that combine multiple character classes and literal characters in sequence.

Here are some examples:

- `\d apple` matches `"1 apple"` (digit followed by `" apple"`)
- `\d apple` does not match `"1 orange"` (doesn't end with `"apple"`)
- `\d\d\d apples` matches `"I got 100 apples from the store"` (found three digits followed by `" apples"`)
- `\d\d\d apples` does not match `"I got 1 apple from the store"` (found only one digit and missing `"s"` in `" apple"`)
- `\d \w\w\ws` matches `"4 cats"` 
- `\d \w\w\ws` does not match `"1 dog"` (missing the `"s"` at the end)

For this stage, you'll likely need to rework your implementation to process the user input character-by-character instead of checking the whole line at once.

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "1 apple" | ./your_program.sh -E "\d apple"
```

Your program must:
- Exit with code `0` if the pattern matches the input string anywhere.
- Exit with code `1` if the pattern does not match the input string.

### Notes
- You'll need to match the pattern sequentiallyâ€”each part of the pattern must match the corresponding part of the input in order.
- Think of your implementation as reading the input like a tape. It advances character by character as it tries to match the pattern.
- If you're looking for ideas on how to approach this, ["A Regular Expression Matcher"](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html) by Rob Pike is a great resource for inspiration. It demonstrates an elegant approach to building a regex matcher. However, you're encouraged to work through the problem yourself first.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
