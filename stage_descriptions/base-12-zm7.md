In this stage, you'll add support for alternation.


### The Alternation Operator (`|`)

The `|` (pipe) operator allows you to match one pattern **or** another. It creates an either/or choice between multiple alternatives.

Alternation is typically used within parentheses to group the alternatives: `(pattern1|pattern2|pattern3)`.

Here are some examples:
- `(cat|dog)` matches `"cat"` (matches first alternative)
- `(cat|dog)` matches `"dog"` (matches second alternative)
- `(cat|dog)` does not match `"apple"` (matches neither)
- `(cat|dog)` matches `"doghouse"` (contains "dog")
- `I like (cats|dogs)` matches `"I like cats"`
- `I like (cats|dogs)` matches `"I like dogs"` 
- `(red|blue|green)` matches `"blue"`

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "cat" | ./your_program.sh -E "(cat|dog)"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the given pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
