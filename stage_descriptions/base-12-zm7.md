In this stage, we'll add support for the `|` keyword, which allows combining multiple patterns in an either/or fashion.

**Example**: `(cat|dog)` should match "dog" and "cat", but not "apple".

Your program will be executed like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "cat" | ./your_program.sh -E "(cat|dog)"
```

Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
