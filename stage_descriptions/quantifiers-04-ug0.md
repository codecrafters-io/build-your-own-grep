In this stage, we'll add support for `{n,m}`, the [between n and m times](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-between-n-and-m-times-nm) quantifier.

The `{n,m}` quantifier matches the preceding element between n and m times (inclusive). The element must appear at least n times but no more than m times.

**Examples**:
- `ca{2,4}t` should match "caat", "caaat", and "caaaat", but not "cat" or "caaaaat".
- `n\d{1,3}m` should match "n1m", "n42m", and "n123m", but not "n1234m".
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` should match "pxyq", "pxyzq", and "pzzzq", but not "pxq" or "pxyzyq".

Your program will be executed like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "caaat" | ./your_program.sh -E "ca{2,4}t"
```

Your program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
