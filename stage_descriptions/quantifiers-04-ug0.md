In this stage, you'll add support for the range quantifier (`{n,m}`).

### The `{n,m}` quanitifier

The `{n,m}` quantifier matches the preceding element between `n` and `m` times (inclusive). This means the element must appear at least `n` times and at most `m` times.

For example:
- `ca{2,4}t` matches `"caat"` (two `"a"`s are within range)
- `ca{2,4}t` matches `"caaat"` (three `"a"`s are within range)
- `ca{2,4}t` matches `"caaaat"` (four `"a"`s are within range)
- `ca{2,4}t` does not match `"caaaaat"` (five `"a"`s are above the maximum)
- `n\d{1,3}m` matches `"n123m"` (three digits are within range)
- `n\d{1,3}m` does not match `"n1234m"` (four digits are above the maximum)
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` matches `"pzzzq"` (three characters are within range)
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` does not match `"pxq"` (one character is below the minimum)
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` does not match `"pxyzyq"` (four characters are above the maximum)
  
### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "caaaat" | ./your_program.sh -E "ca{2,4}t"
```

Your program must:
- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
