In this stage, you'll add support for the range quantifier (`{n,m}`).

### The `{n,m}` quanitifier

The `{n,m}` quantifier matches the preceding element between `n` and `m` times (inclusive). This means the element must appear at least `n` times and at most `m` times.

For example:
- `ca{2,4}t` matches "caat"
- `ca{2,4}t` matches "caaat"
- `ca{2,4}t` matches "caaaat" 
- `ca{2,4}t` does not match "caaaaat"
- `n\d{1,3}m` matches "n123m"
- `n\d{1,3}m` does not match "n1234m"
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` matches "pxyzq"
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` does not match "pxq" 
- `p[xyz]{2,3}q` does not match "pxyzyq"

  
### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "caaaat" | ./your_program.sh -E "ca{2,4}t"
```

Your program must:
- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
