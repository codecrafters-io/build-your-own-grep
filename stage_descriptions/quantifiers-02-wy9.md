In this stage, you'll add support for the `{n}` quantifier.

### The `{n}` Quantifier

The `{n}` quantifier matches the preceding element exactly `n` times.

For example:
- `ca{3}t` matches `"caaat"` (exactly three `"a"`s)
- `ca{3}t` does not match `"caat"` (only two `"a"`s)
- `ca{3}t` does not match `"caaaat"` (too many `"a"`s)
- `d\d{2}g` matches `"d42g"` (exactly two digits)
- `d\d{2}g` does not match `"d1g` (only one digit)
- `d\d{2}g` does not match `"d123g"` (too many digits)
- `c[xyz]{4}w` matches `"czyxzw"` (exactly four characters from `[xyz]`)
- `c[xyz]{4}w` does not match `"cxyzw"` (only three characters from `[xyz]`)

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "appleee" | ./your_program.sh -E "applee{2}"
```

Your program must:
- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
