In this stage, you'll add support for backreferences.

### Capturing Groups

So far, parentheses have been used for grouping alternatives with `|`. However, they can also be used to define a capturing group.

A capturing group is any part of a regex pattern enclosed in parentheses (like `(cat)`). When the pattern matches, the regex engine "captures" (stores) the specific text that matched within those parentheses.

Each capturing group is automatically assigned a number based on the position of its opening parenthesis, counting from left to right and starting at `1`.

### Backreferences

A backreference lets you reuse a captured group in a regular expression. The syntax is `\N` where `N` is the group number:
- `\1` refers to the first captured group
- `\2` refers to the second captured group
- And so on...

For example:
- `(cat) and \1` matches `"cat and cat"` (both are `"cat"`)
- `(cat) and \1` does not match `"cat and dog"` (`"cat"` â‰  `"dog"`)
- `(\w+) and \1` matches `"cat and cat"` 
- `(\w+) and \1` matches `"dog and dog" `
- `(\w+) and \1` does not match `"cat and dog"`
- `(\d+)-\1` matches `"123-123"` (same number repeated)
 
### Tests

Your program will be executed like this:

```
$ echo -n "<input>" | ./your_program.sh -E "<pattern>"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the given pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

### Notes 

- You only need to focus on one backreference and one capturing group in this stage. We'll get to handling multiple backreferences in later stages.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
