In this stage, we'll add support for nested backreferences.

### Nested Capturing Groups

When the capturing groups are nested, each group still gets its own backreference based on the position of its opening parenthesis:
- The outermost group gets numbered first
- Inner groups get numbered as they appear, left to right

For example, let's break down the pattern `('(cat) and \2') is the same as \1`:

- Group 1 (outer): `'(cat) and \2'` 
- Group 2 (inner): `(cat)`
- `\2` refers to Group 2, so it matches` "cat"`
- `\1` refers to Group 1, so it matches the entire `"'cat and cat'"`

An example of an input that matches this pattern would be: `"'cat and cat' is the same as 'cat and cat'"`

Here are some more examples:
- `((dog)-\2)` matches `"dog-dog"` (Group 2 is `"dog"`, Group 1 is `"dog-dog"`)
- `((\w+) \2) and \1` matches `"cat cat and cat cat"`

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```
$ echo -n "'cat and cat' is the same as 'cat and cat'" | ./your_program.sh -E "('(cat) and \2') is the same as \1"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input matches the pattern with nested backreferences.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
