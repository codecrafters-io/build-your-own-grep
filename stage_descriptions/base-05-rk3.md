In this stage, you'll add support for negative character groups.

### Negative Character Groups

[Negative character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#negative-character-group-) are the inverse of positive character groups. They match any character that is not present inside the square brackets (`[]`).

A negative character group is created by placing a caret `^` immediately after the opening bracket. 

The syntax looks like this: `[^characters]`.

For example:
- `[^abc]` should match `"cat"`, since `t` is not in the set `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- `[^abc]` should not match `"cab"`, since all the characters are in the set.

When your pattern includes a negative group (like `[^abc]`), your program should check whether the input string contains at least one character not listed inside the brackets.

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "apple" | ./your_program.sh -E "[^abc]"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input contains any character that is **not** in the negative character group.
- Exit with code `1` if all characters in the input are in the group.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
