In this stage, you'll add support for the end of string or line anchor (`$`).

### End of String or Line Anchor (`$`)

The `$` anchor matches patterns at the very end of the input string.

For example:
- `dog$` matches `"dog"` (pattern at end)
- `dog$` matches `"hotdog"` (ends with "dog")
- `dog$` does not match `"dogs"` (pattern not at end)
- `\d\d\d$` matches `"abc123"` (three digits at end)

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ echo -n "dog" | ./your_program.sh -E "dog$"
```

Your program must:

- Exit with code `0` if the input ends with the given pattern.
- Exit with code `1` if it doesn't.

### Notes
- You can combine `^` and `$` in the same pattern (e.g., `^dog$`) to match the entire string exactly.
- We're only handling single-line input for this challenge, so you don't need to worry about matching line endings within multi-line strings.

Do not use `grep` or the regex utilities available in the standard library. Implement the regex matcher yourself.
